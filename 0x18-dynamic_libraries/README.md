By the end of this project, you should be able to:

Explain what dynamic libraries are, how they work, and how to create and use them
Understand the purpose and usage of the environment variable $LD_LIBRARY_PATH
Differentiate between static and shared libraries
Utilize basic commands such as nm, ldd, and ldconfig
