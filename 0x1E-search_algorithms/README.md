## Learning Objectives

Upon completion of this project, you should be able to:

- Explain what a search algorithm is.
- Understand the concept and implementation of linear search.
- Understand the concept and implementation of binary search.
- Determine the best search algorithm to use based on specific needs.

## Project Requirements

### General

- Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
- Code must be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using `gcc` with specific options.
- Follow the Betty style for code formatting.
- Use `printf` as the only allowed function from the standard library.
- No global variables are allowed.
- Maintain proper code organization and file structure.
- Big O notations must be written in the specified format.

### Tasks

The project consists of the following tasks:

1. Implementing a search algorithm.
2. Implementing a linear search algorithm and documenting its time complexity.
3. Implementing a binary search algorithm and documenting its time complexity.
4. Explaining how to choose the best search algorithm based on specific requirements.
5. Providing a plagiarism warning and emphasizing copyright respect.

### Auto Review

An auto review will be conducted at the project deadline, so ensure your code meets all requirements and standards.
